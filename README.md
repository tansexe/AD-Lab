# Applications Development Lab

This project is part of the **Applications Development Lab** course in the 6th semester. The project explores data analysis, correlation identification, application of machine learning models, and the creation of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to analyze a dataset, explore different correlations, try various machine learning models, and develop a machine learning pipeline to streamline the entire process.

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Analysis**: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its underlying patterns.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated correlations between various features of the dataset and visualized the findings.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Tried several machine learning models to predict target variables and evaluated their performance.
- **ML Pipeline**: Developed a machine learning pipeline to automate the process from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - The dataset is loaded and cleaned.
   - Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations are created to explore the data and understand the relationships between features.
   
3. **Modeling**:
   - Various machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, are tested.
   
4. **Machine Learning Pipeline**:
   - A pipeline is created to automate data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
